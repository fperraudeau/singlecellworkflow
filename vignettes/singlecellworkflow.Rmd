# Introduction


*The introduction provides context as to why the software tool was developed and what need it addresses.  It is good scholarly practice to mention previously developed tools that address similar needs, and why the current tool is needed.*

We propose a worklow for single cell RNA-Seq.

```{r frog-picture, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Our workflow'}
knitr::include_graphics('workflow.png')
```


# Steps of the workflow

Along the worflow, use deviance residuals as adjusted values. The steps of our worflow are as follow

## Dimensionality reduction

zinbwave


## Cluster cells 

clusterExperiment

## Get lineage

slingshot

## Get DE genes

edgeR



# Results <!-- Optional - only if novel data or analyses are included -->
This section is only required if the paper includes novel data or analyses, and should be written as a traditional results section.

# Use Cases <!-- Optional - only if NO new datasets are included -->
This section is required if the paper does not include novel data or analyses. 
Examples of input and output files should be provided with some explanatory context.  Any novel or complex variable parameters should also be explained in sufficient detail to allow users to understand and use the tool's functionality.

# Discussion <!-- Optional - only if novel data or analyses are included -->
This section is only required if the paper includes novel data or analyses, and should be written in the same style as a traditional discussion section.
Please include a brief discussion of allowances made (if any) for controlling bias or unwanted sources of variability, and the limitations of any novel datasets.


# Conclusions <!-- Optional - only if novel data or analyses are included -->
This section is only required if the paper includes novel data or analyses, and should be written as a traditional conclusion.

# Summary <!-- Optional - only if NO new datasets are included -->
This section is required if the paper does not include novel data or analyses.  It allows authors to briefly summarize the key points from the article.

# Data availability <!-- Optional - only if novel data or analyses are included -->
Please add details of where any datasets that are mentioned in the paper, and that have not have not previously been formally published, can be found.  If previously published datasets are mentioned, these should be cited in the references, as per usual scholarly conventions.
