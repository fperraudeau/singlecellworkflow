# Introduction

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful and promising class of high-throughput assays that enable researchers to measure genome-wide transcription levels at the resolution of single cells. To properly account for features specific to scRNA-seq, such as zero inflation and high levels of technical noise, several novel statistical methods have been developed to tackle questions that include dimensionality reduction, clustering, and the inference of cell lineages and pseudotimes. While each individual method is useful on its own for addressing a specific question, there is an increasing need for workflows that integrate these tools to yield a seamless scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline. This is all the more true, with novel sequencing technologies that allow an increasing numer of cells to be sequenced in each run. For example, the Chromium Single Cell 3' Solution was recently used to sequence and profile about 1.3 million cells from embryonic mouse brains. 

scRNA-seq workflows have already been developed, with several useful methods for quality control, visualization, and pre-processing of the data. The workflow for low-level analysis of scRNA-seq data described in [@Lun2016] or the package `scater` [@McCarthy2017] are examples of workflows based on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor Project [@Huber2015] and cover basic steps, including quality control, data exploration, and normalization. In these workflows, single-cell expression data are organized in objects of the SCESet class allowing integrated analysis. However, these workflows are mostly used to prepare the data for further downstream analysis and do not focus on steps like clustering and pseudotime ordering.

Here, we propose an integrated workflow for dowstream analysis, with the following three main steps: dimensionality reduction adjusting for gene and cell-level covariates, robust and stable clustering using resampling-based sequential ensemble clustering, and inference of cell lineages and ordering of the cells by developmental progression. Along the workflow, we use a unique SummarizedExperiment object to create an easy to use sequence of steps, where a different R package is used for each step.

# Analysis of olfactory stem cell lineages using scRNA-seq data
## Overview

```{r stemcelldiff, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Stem cell differentiation in the mouse olfactory epithelium. This figure has been reproduced with kind permission from [@Fletcher2017].'}
knitr::include_graphics('stemcelldiff_Fletcher2017_2e.png')
```

This workflow is illustrated using data from a scRNA-seq study of stem cell differentiation in the mouse olfactory epithelium (OE) [@Fletcher2017]. The olfactory epithelium contains mature olfactory sensory neurons that are continuously renewed in the epithelium via neurogenesis through differentiation of globose basal cells (GBCs), which are the actively proliferating cells in the epithelium. When a severe injury to the entire tissue happens, the olfactory epithelium can regenerate from normally quiescent stem cells called horizontal basal cells (HBCs) which become activated to differentiate and reconstitute all major cell types in the epithelium.   

The scRNA-seq dataset we work with was generated to study the differentitation of HBCs stem cells into different cell types present in the olfactory epithelium. To map the developmental trajectories of the multiple cell lineages arising from HBCs, scRNA-seq was performed on FACS-purified cells using the Fluidigm C1 microfluidics cell capture platform followed by Illumina sequencing. Then, the expression level of each gene in a given cell was quantified by counting the total number of reads mapping to it. Cells were then assigned to different lineages using the statistical analysis pipeline presented in this workflow. Finally, results were validated experimentally using in vivo lineage tracing. Details on data generation and statistical methods are available in [@Fletcher2017] [SD: Add reference to Slingshot and ZINB-WaVE biorXiv manuscripts.].

It was found that the first major bifurcation in the HBC lineage trajectory occurs prior to cell division, producing either mature sustentacular (mSUS) cells or GBCs. Then, the GBC lineage, in turn, branches to give rise to mature olfactory sensory neurons (mOSN), microvillous (MV) cells, and cells of the Bowman’s gland. See Figure \@ref(fig:stemcelldiff). In this study, we show possible steps to recover the lineages found in the original study from the matrix of raw counts publicly available.

FP: ask Russell if we can use the Figure \@ref(fig:stemcelldiff) here.

## Pre-processing

Counts for all genes in each cell were obtained from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE95601. Before filtering, the dataset has 849 cells and 28361 detected genes. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
urls = c("https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE95601&format=file&file=GSE95601%5FoeHBCdiff%5FCufflinks%5FeSet%2ERda%2Egz",
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rufletch/p63-HBC-diff/master/ref/oeHBCdiff_clusterLabels.txt")
         
if(!file.exists("../data/GSE95601_oeHBCdiff_Cufflinks_eSet.Rda")) {
  download.file(urls[1], "../data/GSE95601_oeHBCdiff_Cufflinks_eSet.Rda.gz")
  gunzip("../data/GSE95601_oeHBCdiff_Cufflinks_eSet.Rda.gz")
}

if(!file.exists("../data/oeHBCdiff_clusterLabels.txt")) {
  download.file(urls[2], "../data/oeHBCdiff_clusterLabels.txt")
}
```

```{r}
load("../data/GSE95601_oeHBCdiff_Cufflinks_eSet.Rda")

# count matrix
E <- assayData(Cufflinks_eSet)$counts_table

# Remove undetected genes
E <- na.omit(E)
E <- E[rowSums(E)>0,]
dim(E)
```

We removed the genes corresponding to ERCC spike-ins and the CreER gene as it corresponds to a marker gene for the HBCs cells. Davide, is that correct?

```{r}
# remove ERCC and CreER genes
cre <- E["CreER",]
ercc <- E[grep("^ERCC-", rownames(E)),]
E <- E[grep("^ERCC-", rownames(E), invert = TRUE), ]
E <- E[-which(rownames(E)=="CreER"), ]
dim(E)
```

Along the workflow, we use a SummarizedExperiment object to keep the counts and metadata in a unique object. In the metadata, we dispose of quality control measures for each cell, information on the batches in which the cells were sequenced, and clusters and lineages found in the original publication [@Fletcher2017]. Cells with a cluster of `-2` are cells not assigned to a cluster in the orginal publication.

```{r}
# Extract QC metrics
qc <- as.matrix(protocolData(Cufflinks_eSet)@data)[,c(1:5, 10:18)]
qc <- cbind(qc, CreER = cre, ERCC_reads = colSums(ercc))

# Extract metadata
batch <- droplevels(pData(Cufflinks_eSet)$MD_c1_run_id)
bio <- droplevels(pData(Cufflinks_eSet)$MD_expt_condition)
clusterLabels <- read.table("../data/oeHBCdiff_clusterLabels.txt",
                            sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
m <- match(colnames(E), clusterLabels[, 1])

# Create metadata data.frame
metadata <- data.frame("Experiment" = bio,
                       "Batch" = batch,
                       "clusterLabels" = clusterLabels[m,2],
                       qc)

# symbol for cell not assigned to a lineage in original data
metadata$clusterLabels[is.na(metadata$clusterLabels)] <- -2

se <- SummarizedExperiment(assays = list(counts = E),
                           colData = metadata)
se
```

Using bioconductor package scone, we removed low quality cells that did not pass our quality control rule, that is ... See Figure \@ref(fig:scone). Davide, would you like to describe your choices for scone here?

```{r scone, fig.cap="Plot generated by scone to filter low quality cells."}
# Metric-based Filtering sample-filtering
data("housekeeping")
hk = rownames(se)[toupper(rownames(se)) %in% housekeeping$V1]

mfilt <- metric_sample_filter(assay(se), nreads = colData(se)$NREADS,
                             ralign = colData(se)$RALIGN,
                             pos_controls = rownames(se) %in% hk,
                             zcut = 3, mixture = FALSE,
                             plot = TRUE)
```

```{r sconeFilt}
# Simplify to a single logical
mfilt <- !apply(simplify2array(mfilt[!is.na(mfilt)]), 1, any)
se <- se[, mfilt]
dim(se)
```

Finally, to speed up the computations, we kept only the 1000 most variable genes. We recommend not to be so stringent in your analysis and perform the analysis on more genes.

```{r}
# filtering to top 1000 most variable
vars <- rowVars(log1p(assay(se)))
names(vars) <- rownames(se)
vars <- sort(vars, decreasing = TRUE)
core <- se[names(vars)[1:1000],]
save(core, file="../data/oe_se_1000Var.rda")
```


## Dataset structure
Overall, after the preprocessing steps, our dataset has 1000 genes and 747 cells.
```{r}
core
```

Metadata for the cells is stored in the object colData from the SummarizedExperiment object. Cells have been processed in 18 different batches.

```{r batch}
batch <- colData(core)$Batch
col_batch = c(brewer.pal(9, "Set1"), brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"), 
              brewer.pal(8, "Accent")[1])
names(col_batch) = unique(batch)
table(batch)
```

In original work [@Fletcher2017], cells have been clustered into 14 different clusters where 151 cells were not assigned to a cluster.

```{r original}
clus.labels <- colData(core)[, "clusterLabels"]
col_clus <- c("transparent", brewer.pal(12, "Set3"), brewer.pal(8, "Set2"))
col_clus <- col_clus[1:length(unique(clus.labels))]
names(col_clus) <- sort(unique(clus.labels))
table(clus.labels)
```

Note that some of the batches are confounded with the clusters found in the original work which could be a problem when we correct for batch effect in the dimensionality reduction step.

```{r clustbatch}
table(data.frame(batch = as.vector(batch),
                 cluster = clus.labels))
```

## Dimensionality reduction adjusting for batches

In scRNA-seq analysis, dimensionality reduction is often used as a preliminary step prior to downstream analysis where clustering, pseudotime ordering, or differential expression analysis are performed. It allows the data to become more tractable, both from a statistical (cf. curse of dimensionality) and computational point of view. Additionally, technical noise can be reduced while preserving the often intrinsically low dimensional signal of interest [@Peer2017].

Here, we perform dimensionality reduction using bioconductor package zinbwave which allows to fit a zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE) to get a low-dimensional representation of the data while accounting for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. The model can include a sample-level intercept, which serves as a global-scaling normalization factor. The user can also include both gene-level and sample-level covariates. The inclusion of observed and unobserved sample-level covariates enables normalization for complex, non-linear effects (often referred to as batch effects), while gene-level covariates may be used to adjust for sequence composition effects, such as gene length and GC-content effects. You can read more details about the ZINB-WaVE model in [@Risso2017].

As with most of the dimensionality reduction methods, the user needs to specify the number of dimensions of the new low dimensional space. Here, we use `K = 50` dimensions in the low dimensional space and adjusted for the batches.

```{r zinb}
fn <- '../data/zinb_batch.rda'
if (runZinb & !file.exists(fn)){
  print(system.time(se <- zinbDimRed(core, K = 50, X = '~ Batch',
                                       residuals = TRUE,
                                       normalizedValues = TRUE)))
  save(se, file = fn)
}else{
  load(fn)
}
```

DR: the chunk above and the similar one for clusterExperiment are fine for now, but in the published workflow, we should just rely on the markdown cache system (the code above doesn't check for changes to the file or code -- just that a version of the file exists). FP: Yes.

### Normalized values

When function `zinbDimRed` is called, normalized values of the counts can be computed and used for visualization (e.g. in heatmaps). The normalized values are the residuals of the fit of the ZINB-WaVE model where the gene and cell covariates were specified by the user when calling function `zinbDimRed`, but no low dimensional matrix is computed. In that case, the residuals represent the counts adjusted for the gene and cell covariates and should capture the biological signal of interest. To compute the residuals, the deviance is used. 

```{r norm}
norm <- assays(se)$normalizedValues
if (sum(is.infinite(norm))>0){
  maxNorm = max(norm[!is.infinite(norm)])
  assays(se)$normalizedValues[is.infinite(norm)] <- maxNorm
  norm <- assays(se)$normalizedValues
}
norm[1:3,1:3]
```

As expected, the normalized values are uniformly distributed for the different batches. See Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotNorm).

```{r boxplotNorm, fig.cap="Boxplot of normalized values. Different colors are for different batches."}
norm_order <- norm[, order(as.numeric(batch))]
col_order <- col_batch[batch[order(as.numeric(batch))]]
boxplot(norm_order, col = col_order, staplewex = 0, outline = 0,
        border = col_order, xaxt = 'n')
abline(h=0)
```

The principal component analysis (PCA) of the normalized values shows that, as expected, cells do not cluster by batch but by orginal published clusters. See Figure \@ref(fig:pcanorm). Overall, looking at the normalized values, it seems that the batch effect has been removed.

```{r pcanorm, fig.cap="PCA of normalized values where each point represent a cell. In the left panel, cells have been colored according to their batch. In the right panel, colors correspond to the original published clusters."}
pca <- prcomp(t(norm))
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(pca$x, col = col_batch[batch], pch = 20, main = '')
plot(pca$x, col = col_clus[as.character(clus.labels)], pch = 20, main = '')
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

### Dimensionality reduction

Calling function `zinbDimRed` from package `zinbwave`, we performed dimensionality reduction where the number of dimensions in the low dimensional space is `K = 50`. We call the matrix in the low dimensional space `W`. We can visualize `W` in two dimensions by performing multidimensional scaling (MDS) on the distance matrix of `W` where the euclidian distance is used. To make sure that `W` captured the biological signal of interest, we plotted the MDS of `W` with colors corresponding to the original published clusters. See Figure \@ref(fig:mdsW).

```{r mdsW, fig.cap="MDS of the low dimensional matrix `W` where each point represent a cell. Cells have been colored according to the original published clusters."}
W <- colData(se)[, grepl('^W', colnames(colData(se)))]
W <- as.matrix(W)
d <- dist(W)
fit <- cmdscale(d, eig = TRUE, k = 2)
plot(fit$points, col = col_clus[as.character(clus.labels)], main = '',
     pch = 20, xlab = 'Component 1', ylab = 'Component 2')
legend(x = 'bottomright', legend = unique(names(col_clus)), cex = .5,
       fill = unique(col_clus), title = 'Sample')
```

## Clustering of the cells

The next step of the workflow is to cluster the cells according to the low dimensional matrix `W` computed in the previous step. We used function `RSEC` from bioconductor package clusterExperiment. Function `RSEC` implements a resampling-based sequential ensemble clustering method for identifying stable and tight cell clusters. The method aggregates multiple clustering results obtained from different base clustering algorithms and applications of a given algorithm to resampled versions of the learning set.

Elizabeth, would you like to more details on the rational and arguments of the different functions?

```{r rsec_50}
fn <- '../data/RSEC_W_combineMinSize10.rda'
if (runClus & !file.exists(fn)){
  #symbol for samples missing from original clustering
  seObj <- SummarizedExperiment(t(W), colData = colData(core))
  print(system.time(ceObj <- RSEC(seObj, k0s = 4:15, alphas = c(0.1),
                                  betas = 0.8, dimReduce="none",
                clusterFunction = "hierarchical01", minSizes=1,
                ncores = NCORES, isCount=FALSE,
                subsampleArgs = list(resamp.num=100,
                                     clusterFunction="kmeans",
                                     clusterArgs=list(nstart=10)),
                seqArgs = list(k.min=3, top.can=5), verbose=TRUE,
                combineProportion = 0.7,
                mergeMethod = "none", random.seed=424242,
                combineMinSize = 10)))
  save(ceObj, file = fn)
}else{
  load(fn)
}
```

We can visualize the resulting clusterings using the `plotClusters` function. See Figure \@ref(fig:examineCombineMany) where cells are in the columns, and different clusterings on the rows. Each sample is color coded based on its clustering for that row, where the colors have been chosen to try to match up clusters across different clusterings that show large overlap. The first raw correspond to a consensus clustering across the many different clusterings performed.

```{r examineCombineMany, fig.cap="Clusters found using function RSEC from clusterExperiment package."}
plotClusters(ceObj, colPalette = c(bigPalette, rainbow(199)))
```

We can also visualize the proportion of times the consensus clusters were together across the different clusterings. See Figure \@ref(fig:plotcoclust).

```{r plotcoclust, fig.cap="Heatmap of the proportion of times the clusters were together across the different clusterings."}
plotCoClustering(ceObj)
```

Over stable and robust clustering, the number of cells in each cluster is as follow

```{r tableclust}
table(primaryClusterNamed(ceObj))
```

We can now plot a heatmap of the normalized values for the 1000 most variable genes where the cells have been clustered using the `RSEC` function. See Figure \@ref(fig:heatmapsClusters).

```{r heatmapsClusters, fig.cap="Heatmap of the normalized values for the 1000 most variable genes where genes are in the rows and cells in the columns."}
# set colors for cell clusterings
colData(ceObj)$clusterLabels <- as.factor(colData(ceObj)$clusterLabels)
origClusterColors <- bigPalette[1:nlevels(colData(ceObj)$clusterLabels)]
experimentColors <- bigPalette[1:nlevels(colData(ceObj)$Experiment)]
batchColors <- bigPalette[1:nlevels(colData(ceObj)$Batch)]
metaColors <- list("Experiment" = experimentColors,
                   "Batch" = batchColors,
                   "clusterLabels" = origClusterColors)

plotHeatmap(ceObj, visualizeData = assays(se)$normalizedValues,
            whichClusters = "primary", clusterFeaturesData = "all",
            clusterSamplesData = "dendrogramValue", breaks = 0.99,
            sampleData = c("clusterLabels", "Batch", "Experiment"),
            clusterLegend = metaColors, annLegend = FALSE, main = '')
```

Finally, we can visualize the cells in a two dimensional space by plotting the MDS of the low dimensional matrix `W` coloring the cells by their newly found clusters. See Figure \@ref(fig:mdsWce) which is the same as Figure \@ref(fig:mdsW) but where colors are for the newly found clusters instead of the clusters found in the orginal published work.

```{r mdsWce, fig.cap="MDS of the low dimensional matrix with K = 50 dimensions. Colors correspond to the clusters found using our workflow."}
palDF <- ceObj@clusterLegend[[1]]
pal <- palDF[, 'color']
names(pal) <- palDF[, 'name']
pal["-1"] = "transparent"
plot(fit$points, col = pal[primaryClusterNamed(ceObj)], main = '', pch = 20,
     xlab = 'Component1', ylab = 'Component2')
legend(x = 'bottomright', legend = names(pal), cex = .5,
       fill = pal, title = 'Sample')
```

## Pseudotime ordering

We now want to demonstrate how to use the R software package `slingshot` to infer branching lineages and order cells by developmental progression. We connect the clusters identified by `RSEC` with a minimum spanning tree to learn the global lineage structure. Then, we refine this structure and order cells using highly stable simultaneous principal curves to infer smooth, branching lineages. 

From the original published work, we know that the start clusters should be the clusters with HBCs and end clusters the clusters with MV, mOSN, and mSUS cells. Additionally, we know that the clusters with the GBCs should be a junction before the differentiation between MV and mOSN cells. See Figure \@ref(fig:stemcelldiff). The correspondance between the clusters we found and the original clusters is as follow

```{r tabagain}
table(data.frame(original = clus.labels, ours = primaryClusterNamed(ceObj)))
```

Cluster name | Description | Color | Correspondence
-------------|-------------|-------| ----------
c1 | HBCs | blue | original 1, 5
c2 | GBCs | green | original 2, 3, 11
c3 | mSUS | red | original 4, 7
c4 | mOSN | orange | original 9, 12
c5 | Immature Neuron | purple | original 10, 14
c6 | MV | brown | original 15

To order the clusters and find lineages, we use package `slingshot` where the input is the MDS of low dimensional matrix `W` where the number of dimensions used for MDS is `k = 4`. We found that slingshot algorithm is stable to the number of dimensions `k` of the MDS. Here, we use the unsupervised version of slingshot where we only provide the information of the start cluster but not the end clusters. Using slingshot, we recovered the order of the clusters found in the published work. See Figures \@ref(fig:curves) and \@ref(fig:tree).

Kelly, would you like to give details about slingshot algorithm?

```{r}
our_cl <- primaryClusterNamed(ceObj)
cl = our_cl[our_cl != "-1"]
pal = pal[names(pal) != '-1']
X <- W[our_cl != "-1", ]
mds <- cmdscale(dist(X), eig = TRUE, k = 4)
X <- mds$points

lineages <- get_lineages(X, clus.labels = cl, start.clus = "c1")
curves <- get_curves(X, clus.labels = cl, lineages = lineages)
```

```{r curves, fig.cap="Cells colored by cluster in a 4-dimensional space with smooth curves representing each inferred lineage."}
plot_curves(X, cl, curves, col.clus = pal)
```

```{r tree, fig.cap="Cells colored by cluster in a 4-dimensional space with connecting lines between cluster centers representing the inferred structure."}
plot_tree(X, cl, lineages, col.clus = pal)
```

```{r lineages}
print(lineages$lineage1)
print(lineages$lineage2)
print(lineages$lineage3)
```

In the workflow, we recover a reasonable pseudotime ordering of the clusters using the unsupervised version of slingshot. However, in some other cases, we have noticed that we need to give more guidance to the algorithm to find the correct ordering. Slingshot has the option for the user to provide the end cluster(s). Here is the code to use slingshot in a supervised setting 

```{r slingshotsupervised, eval=FALSE}
lineages <- get_lineages(X, clus.labels = cl, start.clus = "c1",
                         end.clus = c("c3", "c6"))
curves <- get_curves(X, clus.labels = cl, lineages = lineages)
plot_curves(X, cl, curves, col.clus = pal)
plot_tree(X, cl, lineages, col.clus = pal)

print(lineages$lineage1)
print(lineages$lineage2)
print(lineages$lineage3)
```

## DE analysis

Kelly, would you like to complete this part? Here is the kind of plots we would want to present.

```{r de, eval = FALSE}
de <- read.csv('../data/oe_markers.txt', stringsAsFactors = F, header = F)
de <- de$V1
plotHeatmap(ceObj, 
            visualizeData = assays(se)$normalizedValues[rownames(se) %in% de, ],
            clusterSamplesData = "dendrogramValue",
            whichClusters = "primary",
            main = 'Normalized values, 1000 most variable genes',
            breaks = 0.99)

## Further developments

In an effort to improve the workflow and analysis of scRNA-seq data, we are currently exploring statistical methods to perform DE analysis using the models we developed. One the one hand, we are developing a DE analysis method using the framework of slingshot which would take advantage of the lineages found. On the other hand, we are working on a DE analysis method using the ZINB-WaVE model which would account for the dropouts and gene and cell-level covariates. Additionally, we are working on a statistical method using the ZINB-WaVE model to impute the dropouts in the scRNA-seq data. This matrix with imputed counts could for example be used in the workflow in the dimensionality reduction, clustering or pseudo ordering steps. 

Finally, a new R class called SingleCellExperiment should be released soon. This new class would essentially be a SummarizedExperiment class with a couple of additional slots, the most important of which is reducedDims, which, much like the assays slot of SummarizedExperiment can contain one or more matrices with reduced dimensional matrices. This new SingleCellExperiment class would be a valuable addition to the workflow as we could store in one object the raw counts as well as the low dimensional matrix created by the dimensionality reduction step. Once this class is implemented, we would like to incorporate it to the workflow.

# Conclusion

This workflow provides guidance to perform downstream analysis of scRNA-seq datasets in R. We propose a worflow in four steps: dimensionality reduction adjusting for cell-level covariates, robust and stable clustering, pseudotime ordering, and DE analysis between the lineages. The workflow is general and flexible allowing the user to sustitute the statistical method used in each step of the worflow by a different method. We hope our proposed workflow will ease the technical aspect of scRNA-seq data analysis and help focusing on discovering new biological insights.
